<h1> JavaScript_App Project: </h1>

<p>This project was made to build a Pokedex of Pokemon characters using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

<h2> Description: </h2>

<p> For this project the goal was to make and apply a list/database from an already established source. I used jQuery and Bootstrap for the final version of this project. A part of the project was to include height, weight, type, and images for Pokemon. A nav bar and buttons were also utilized.  </p>
