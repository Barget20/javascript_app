For this project the goal was to make and apply a list/database from somewhere. For this project we chose the Pokedex for pokemon. We were also tasked to use jQuery and Bootstrap for the final version of this project. 
A part of the project was to include images, height, weight, and type. We also applied a nav bar and buttons. 
In this project I was introduced to minifying projects and using a dist folder.
In the future I would like to alphabetize the order of the pokemon and possibly add a search feature.
